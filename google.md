# Research - Google

## Link
http://www.google.com

## Description
The first place to look for answers to questions that are not covered by the documentation provided.

## Usage
Google is usualy the first stop for any question. And the last.

Being able to use Google or any other search engine is a basic primary skill. If you "do not feel like looking stuff up *all the time*", this is the *first* thing you should to work on before continuing with anything else.

## Google all the things
If you find yourself asking "how do I...?": google it. If you heard yourself saying: 'I don't know': google it!

Look up **every single thing** you don't understand.
